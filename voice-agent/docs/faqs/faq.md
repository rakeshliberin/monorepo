## Piped Natural Gas (PNG)

### What is PNG?

Piped Natural Gas, or PNG, is supplied directly to your kitchen through a pipeline. This is different from LPG, which comes in cylinders. PNG is mainly Methane.

### Benefits of PNG

- **Uninterrupted Supply:** PNG is available 24x7, so you don't need to book refills or wait for deliveries.
- **Convenience:** It saves kitchen space because there are no cylinders to store. You don't have to worry about connecting, disconnecting, or checking cylinders for leaks or correct weight.
- **Safety:** PNG is lighter than air and disperses quickly upwards in case of a leak. LPG is heavier and settles near the floor, which is a greater fire risk. The PNG system operates at a very low pressure.
- **Environmentally Friendly:** It's a clean-burning fuel that produces fewer pollutants like CO2 and no SO2 compared to other fossil fuels.
- **Cost-Effective:** You pay only for what you use, based on meter readings. It also leads to lower maintenance costs for your appliances as it doesn't produce soot or greasy deposits.
- **Transparent Billing:** Bills are based on actual consumption recorded by a meter, so there is no chance of spillage or pilferage.

### PNG Pricing (per SCM)

- **Delhi:** ₹48.59
- **Gurugram, Rewari, Karnal, Kaithal:** ₹47.40
- **Noida, Greater Noida, Ghaziabad:** ₹48.46
- **Meerut & Shamli, Muzaffarnagar:** ₹49.35
- **Kanpur, Fatehpur & Hamirpur, Mahoba & Banda:** ₹49.95
- **Ajmer, Pali & Rajsamand:** ₹49.27

### Minimum Consumption Charges

If your gas consumption in a two-month billing cycle is less than 4 Standard Cubic Meters (SCM), you will be charged for a minimum of 4 SCM.

## New PNG Connections

### How to Register

You can register for a new PNG connection by:

- Visiting the IGL website or using the IGL Connect Mobile App.
- Calling the customer care numbers to raise a request.
- Submitting a physical application form where applicable.

### Technical Feasibility Criteria

For a PNG connection to be technically feasible, certain conditions must be met:

- **Accessibility:** The area must be accessible for emergency vehicles like fire tenders. The building should have space to lay the main MDPE pipeline. Under-developed slums, water-logged areas, or very narrow lanes are considered not feasible.
- **Regulator Position:** The regulator must be installed on a permanent structure, like an outside wall, in an area that is open to the air and easily accessible.
- **Pipe Installation:**
  - The gas pipeline must be supported by a permanent structure like a concrete wall and cannot be left hanging.
  - The pipe must enter the kitchen or bathroom directly, not through a bedroom or living room, unless an alternative open-air route is available.
  - The pipe must enter through a vertical wall, not the ceiling.
  - The pipe and meter must be at least 300mm away from any electrical points, cables, or cooking appliances.
- **Pipe Concealment:** The gas pipeline must always be exposed and not hidden or camouflaged inside walls or panels.
- **Meter Location:** The meter should be installed in a place open to the atmosphere, either inside or outside the kitchen, where it is easy to read and access for maintenance.
- **Kitchen Ventilation:** The kitchen must have permanent ventilation, like a window of at least 35x35 sq. cm, or be a door-less kitchen.

### Appliance Conversion

To use PNG, your existing LPG stove needs a minor modification. This conversion is done by trained IGL technicians.

## PNG Meter and Billing

### Reading Your Meter

Your gas meter has two sets of digits. The digits on the black background represent the whole number part of the reading, and the digits on the red background are the decimal part. When submitting a reading, you should enter all digits from left to right.

You can find your meter number written on the meter itself. This number should match the one on your bill.

### Billing Cycle and Meter Reading

An IGL representative will collect a meter reading once every two months. If the representative cannot access your premises, they will leave a note saying "We Missed You."

If your reading is missed, you can:

- Use the "Self-Billing" feature on the IGL Connect App.
- Share a photo of the meter on the WhatsApp number mentioned on the note.
- Call the customer care number and provide your reading.

### Retail vs. Estimated Bills

- A **Retail Bill** is generated based on an actual meter reading.
- An **Estimated Bill** is generated when an actual reading is not available. It is based on your past average consumption. Any difference between the estimated amount and your actual usage is automatically adjusted in the next retail bill.
- You are required to pay estimated bills by the due date to avoid late fees.
- If you receive three consecutive estimated bills, your connection may be disconnected. It is important to provide an actual reading to avoid this.

### Self-Billing

Self-billing allows you to generate your own bill using the IGL Connect Mobile App.

- **How it works:** Log in to the IGL Connect app, click on "Self Billing," enter your meter reading, and upload a clear, real-time picture of the meter.
- **Frequency:** You can do this whenever you need, but you must maintain a gap of at least 21 days from your last bill date.
- **Requirement:** You must be subscribed to E-bills. No hard copy will be sent.
- **Bill Delivery:** The bill will be generated within 24 hours and sent to your registered email address.
- **Benefits:** This avoids issues with missed readings or estimated bills and allows you to break your bi-monthly bill into monthly payments if you wish.

### Correcting a Bill

If you believe the meter reading on your bill is wrong, first check if the bill is "Retail" or "Estimated." If it's incorrect, you can register a complaint through the call center, the IGL app, or the website. Provide your current meter reading, and IGL will investigate and make corrections if needed.

### E-bills

An E-bill is a paperless bill sent to your email ID. Subscribing to E-bills helps save paper and is mandatory for using the self-billing feature. You can subscribe via the IGL Connect app, the website, by calling customer care, or by emailing optebill@igl.co.in.

## PNG Payments

## Compressed Natural Gas (CNG)

### What is CNG?

CNG stands for Compressed Natural Gas. It is a gaseous fuel, mainly composed of methane. For use in vehicles, it is compressed to a pressure of 200-250 kilograms per square centimeter.

### Benefits and Safety of CNG

- **Safe:** CNG is considered very safe. It is lighter than air, so it rises and disperses in case of a leak. It also has a high ignition temperature of 540 degrees Celsius, making it less likely to ignite accidentally compared to petrol. It will not burn if its concentration in the air is less than 5% or more than 15%.
- **Cost-Effective:** Using CNG can reduce your fuel bill by approximately 50% compared to petrol at current prices in Delhi.
- **Environmentally Friendly:** CNG burns cleanly and produces significantly fewer pollutants and carbon dioxide than petrol or diesel. Exhaust fumes contain mainly water vapor and a small fraction of carbon monoxide.
- **Good for Engine:** CNG does not dilute or contaminate engine oil. It reduces engine wear and tear because it enters the engine as a gas, not a liquid spray.

### CNG Pricing (per Kg)

- **NCT of Delhi:** ₹75.09
- **Gurugram:** ₹82.12
- **Rewari:** ₹82.70
- **Noida, Greater Noida, Ghaziabad:** ₹83.70
- **Karnal & Kaithal:** ₹83.43
- **Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Shamli:** ₹85.08
- **Kanpur, Hamirpur, Fatehpur:** ₹87.92
- **Ajmer, Pali, Rajsamand:** ₹86.44
- **Mahoba, Banda, Chitrakoot:** ₹83.92

### Vehicle Conversion

- **Petrol Vehicles:** Any spark-ignited (petrol) engine can be converted to run on CNG using a special conversion kit. The kit includes a cylinder for the boot and other equipment. After conversion, the vehicle can switch between CNG and petrol with a simple flick of a switch on the dashboard.
- **Diesel Vehicles:** Diesel vehicles can also be converted to run on CNG, but the conversion cost is higher. Currently, converted diesel vehicles cannot run in dual-fuel mode.

### CNG Cylinders

- **Construction:** CNG cylinders are made from seamless special steel alloy and are built to withstand high pressure up to 200 kg/cm2. They are tested and approved by the Chief Controller of Explosives.
- **Safety Feature:** They are fitted with a 'safety burst disc' that ruptures to release pressure safely if the temperature or pressure inside gets too high.
- **Weight and Size:** An empty 50-liter cylinder, which is the most common size, weighs about 48 kg.

### Vehicle Care and Maintenance

- **Servicing:** CNG kits do not require frequent servicing, but routine checks are advised. Servicing should only be done by an authorized person.
- **Hydro Testing:** The CNG cylinder must undergo a hydro-stretch test every 3 years to check its pressure tolerance. You can find authorized testing centers on the IGL website.
- **Insurance:** You must inform your insurance company after installing a CNG kit to get it covered. You may need to pay an additional premium.
- **Pollution Certificate:** Even after converting to CNG, you are still required to get a pollution check and obtain a certificate.
- **Safety Precautions:**
  - Do not replace a CNG cylinder with an LPG cylinder; it is illegal and unsafe.
  - If you need to do any welding or heat application work on the vehicle near the cylinder, the cylinder must be emptied first.
  - It's a good practice to occasionally run the vehicle on petrol to keep the petrol system in good working condition.

## Account Management

### Ownership Transfer

If you buy a property with an existing IGL connection, you need to transfer the ownership to your name. This can be done online through the IGL web portal.

- **Process:** Log in to the IGL portal using the Business Partner (BP) number, navigate to the "Ownership Transfer" section, upload the required documents, and submit the request.
- **Documents needed:** This typically includes registered property papers (like a sale deed), a copy of a recent electricity bill, an NOC from the previous owner, and your ID proof.
- **Charges:** A fee of ₹590 (₹500 + GST) will be charged in your next bill for a successful ownership transfer.
- **Outstanding Dues:** Any pending bills on the connection must be cleared before the transfer request can be processed.

### Minor Account Corrections

For minor corrections like spelling mistakes in your name or updates to your address, you can:

- Send an email from your registered email ID to `updatekyc@igl.co.in`.
- Call the 24x7 customer care helpline.
  The update will be done within 5 working days.

### Temporary Disconnection ("Not in Use" facility)

If your premises will be vacant for a few months, you can request a "Temporary Disconnection." This is advisable for safety. You will be charged a minimal maintenance fee of ₹25 per month until the service is restored.

### Connection Disconnection and Restoration

A connection can be disconnected if bills are not paid for two billing cycles. To restore the connection, you must pay the entire outstanding amount plus a restoration charge of ₹3000.

### Security Deposits (ACSD)

ACSD stands for "Additional Consumption Security Deposit." It is a refundable deposit calculated based on your average consumption over the last year.

## Prepaid Meters

### How They Work

With a prepaid meter, you pay for gas in advance. An Equated Daily Installment (EDI) of ₹8 or an equivalent amount of gas is deducted from your balance every day to cover the meter's cost.

### Security Deposit

The total security deposit for a prepaid connection is ₹5500. This includes ₹5000 for equipment security and ₹500 for gas security.

### Troubleshooting

- **No Recharge Alert:** If you don't receive a recharge alert, please contact the control room and ensure your mobile number is updated.
- **Gas Supply Stopped After Recharge:** This could be due to a technical issue with the meter or an error in posting the recharge. In either case, register a complaint with the control room.
- **Meter Issues:** If your meter valve closes on its own or you think the meter is running fast, raise a complaint with the control room or call center. IGL will inspect the meter and replace it if it's found to be faulty.

### Non-Usage Charges

Even if you don't use any gas, a minimum charge equivalent to 4 SCM is deducted every two months.
