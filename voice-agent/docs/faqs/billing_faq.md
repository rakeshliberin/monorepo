**question:**  
I have already paid my bill, but the app/website still shows an outstanding amount. What should I do?

**answer:**

1. **Check when and how you paid.**  
   • Note the time elapsed between your payment date and today.  
   • Identify the payment channel you used.

2. **Payment made on IGL website / IGL app**  
   • If **<24h** have passed → wait until a full 24h has elapsed.  
   • If **≥24h** have passed → raise a support ticket.

3. **Payment made via third‑party (Google Pay, PhonePe, etc.)**  
   • If **<3days** have passed → wait until 72h have elapsed.  
   • If **≥3days** have passed → raise a support ticket.

**question:**  
Why am I receiving a payment‑reminder SMS?

**answer:**

1. **Verify your current outstanding amount.**  
   • If the outstanding amount is **₹0** your payment has been received—ignore the reminder SMS.  
   • If you still owe a balance, pay the bill **before the due date** to avoid late‑payment charges.
