# CNG Vehicle Care Guidelines

## Safety Precautions During Servicing
- In case of leakage in fuel system, vehicles shall not be parked within 6 meters of any source of ignition or fire.
- In case of vehicles undergoing repairs involving welding or heat application to any part (within 1.5 meters) of the cylinder, the cylinder should be emptied first.

## Do's and Don'ts
- Always refer to the supplier's kit manual for the trouble-shooting guide and do not attempt repairs yourself.
- Do not install a LPG, Propane or any other cylinder in place of a CNG cylinder. It is illegal and unsafe.
- For emergency handling of any CNG leak, users must be aware of the location and operation of cylinder valve, master shut-off valve and burst disc in the CNG system.
- Study the system and ask your mechanic to identify these parts for you.
- Workshop doing the kit fitment should be able to demonstrate these operations to your satisfaction.
- It is advisable to operate the vehicle occasionally on petrol to ensure that the petrol system remains in good working conditions.

## Insurance Requirements
- The CNG kit installed in the vehicle should be insured along with vehicle accessories.
- The motorist should notify the insurance company to provide insurance on the CNG system, for which additional premium may be charged.
- Motorists should take the insurance cover for the additional CNG kit system.

## Pollution Regulations
- As per present government regulation, pollution check and a pollution certificate is mandatory even after converting the vehicle to CNG.

## Safety Information
- A pressurized gas cylinder is probably the strongest component on the vehicle.
- Vehicles that were totally destroyed in collisions show the only discernible component being the intact gas cylinder.
- It is unlikely that cylinders will rupture due to collision impact.
- The risk of fire from leaking cylinders is low, with over 3 million CNG vehicle installations worldwide that have not experienced such problems.
- Natural gas is lighter than air and in the unlikely event of a leak, the gas will dissipate upwards quickly.
- In contrast, petrol and LPG vapor is heavier than air and will tend to pool near the ground.

## Maintenance Requirements
- Hydro testing of CNG cylinder needs to be done after every 3 years.
