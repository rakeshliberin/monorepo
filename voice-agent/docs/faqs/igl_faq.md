# IGL Frequently Asked Questions

## Self-Billing

### Is it better to place the meter inside or outside Kitchen?

There is no preference. It depends on the spatial arrangement.

Self Billing is an additional facility to the PNG Domestic customer through which retail bill/invoice can be generated at customer convenience by submitting meter reading and photograph through IGL Connect Mobile App irrespective of bi-monthly billing.

3. Click on Self Billing. Insert Meter reading. (Submit meter reading from left to right. For example, if the meter reading is 00350.105, press the digits in the same sequence: 0, 0, 3, 5, 0, 1, 0, 5.)
4. Upload the real-time clear picture of the meter and submit.

### When can I do self-billing? Clarify the time period.

Self-billing can be done as and when required irrespective of the regular bi-monthly billing cycle; however, it is essential to maintain a gap of 21 days from the last invoice/bill date. Otherwise, self-billing cannot be done.

- No worries on missed meter reading or requirement of a meter-reader visit.
- Get instant resolution to your meter reading related complaints.

## Meter Reading

### Is it better to place the meter inside or outside Kitchen?

There is no preference. It depends on the spatial arrangement.

### How do I know my meter number?

The meter installed at your premises has the meter number written on it. The same should match with the meter number mentioned on your bill.

### What is the frequency of meter reading collection?

It happens once every 2 months by an IGL authorized representative.

### There was a note at my door saying "We Missed You". What does it mean?

If the meter reading could not be collected because the premises was locked or for another reason, you may perform Self Billing through the IGL Connect App (available on Google Play Store or Apple iStore) or share the meter reading on the WhatsApp number mentioned on the note.

### How can I submit my reading if it's missed?

The note left behind has a WhatsApp number on it. You can share the meter photograph on that WhatsApp number. You can also call the customer care number and provide your reading. Alternatively, you can do self-billing through the IGL Connect App.

### Can I do self-submission of reading for billing?

Yes. We offer a facility known as "Self-Billing" through the IGL Connect App. You need to submit the meter reading and upload a meter picture to initiate billing yourself. Please remember you must maintain a gap of 21 days from the last invoice date, and preferably be E-bill subscribed.

### How to read the meter? Which digits to note?

The meter reading is in two parts: black digits (the whole number) and red digits (the decimal part).

### The meter reading on my bill is wrong. What should I do?

Please check if the invoice is "Estimated" or "Retail" as mentioned on the top left corner of the bill. If something is incorrect, register a complaint either at the call centre, through the app, or online, providing clear details of your current meter reading. IGL will investigate and correct any discrepancy found.

## Billing

### What is E bill?

It is a paperless bill. You can now receive the invoice on your email ID by registering for E-Bill. By doing this, you can reduce paper wastage and help save the environment.

### The invoice is sometimes "Retail" and sometimes "Estimated." What does it mean?

An invoice billed on an actual meter reading is a retail bill. An "Estimated" bill is generated when the actual reading is not available and is based on past average consumption. Upon receipt of the actual meter reading at a later stage, necessary adjustments are made.

### What is an estimated bill? How is it calculated?

An estimated bill is raised when, for some reason, the actual reading is not available. This provisional bill is based on average consumption from past months where the reading was taken. If the current provisional bill is found to exceed actual usage, it is automatically adjusted on the next actual (retail) bill.

### Are estimated bills payable?

Yes. An estimated bill must be paid just like any other retail (actual) bill, before the mentioned due date. If not paid by the due date, late payment charges shall be levied in the next bill. Adjustments, if any, are provided on the subsequent actual bill.

### What happens in case of continuous estimated billing?

The connection shall be liable for disconnection after three consecutive estimated bills. You are advised to provide a current meter reading (via call centre, app, etc.) so that a retail bill can be generated.

### LPSC stands for?

LPSC means Late Payment Surcharge, applicable when a bill is not paid by the due date. It is levied at 2% of the outstanding amount.

### If the premises are vacant, can I avail a "Not in Use" facility? Is it beneficial to the customer?

Yes. It is advisable to place a request at IGL Customer Care for "Temporary Disconnection" when you are away for a few months. This is also important from a safety perspective. After temporary disconnection, your bill as on date will be generated. You will be charged a minimal maintenance charge of Rs. 25 per month until services are restored. No bill would be generated until restoration.

### I have not received my bill; how can I get a duplicate copy?

To view any billing information, we provide the following choices:
a) Customer can simply log on to www.iglconnect.co.in and register with the BP No.
b) Alternatively, please call our call centre and request a duplicate bill.

Please register a complaint at the call centre, app, or online, clearly providing your current meter reading. We will investigate and correct any discrepancy.

### When is a connection liable for disconnection?

### What is ACSD and how do we calculate it?

ACSD stands for "Additional Consumption Security Deposit." It is a refundable security deposit against consumption, calculated based on your average daily consumption over the last year and the prevailing price. Slabs may vary; any applicable refund is assessed upon request.

## New Connection and Why PNG

### What is the difference between PNG and LPG?

LPG is Liquefied Petroleum Gas and PNG is Piped Natural Gas. LPG comes in cylinders of various capacities, whereas PNG is supplied through a pipeline directly to your kitchen.

### How is PNG better than LPG?

PNG offers several advantages over LPG and provides unmatched convenience:

- Continuous and uninterrupted supply: Available 24x7, no monthly booking.
- Safety: PNG is lighter than air and disperses quickly in case of leakage; LPG is heavier and can settle, posing higher fire risk.
- Clutter-free: PNG uses a small pipeline, saving kitchen space.
- Consumption-based billing: Pay only for what you use.
- A greener fuel: Lower carbon to hydrogen ratio makes PNG cleaner.

### What changes are required for conversion of an LPG appliance to be PNG-friendly?

PNG works on a cooking appliance similarly to LPG. Converting an existing LPG appliance is done by trained IGL technicians.

### How do I register for a new connection?

To register for a new connection request, customers may use any of the following options:

- Visit the IGL website or IGL Connect Mobile App.
- Call the IGL customer care numbers to raise a request.
- Submit a physical application form if applicable.
